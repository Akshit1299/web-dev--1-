        The Conjuring House is the real-life 1736 farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island, where the Perron family
        reported experiencing intense supernatural phenomena in the 1970s, leading to their involvement with paranormal
        investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren and inspiring the film The Conjuring. The property continues to attract
        interest from ghost hunters and tourists for its historical significance and ongoing alleged paranormal
        activity. </p>

    <p>church is a public place of worship, usually for people of the Christian religion. Some Christian denominations,
        or groups, also have buildings called cathedrals. A cathedral serves as the central, or main, church for a
        geographical area. The layout and design of churches can vary greatly.</p>
